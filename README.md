# School Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing three of my old school projects developed during my Grade 9 and Grade 10 classes. These projects reflect my early journey into programming and problem-solving.

## Disclaimer
As I upload these projects to GitHub alongside my other older projects, it's important to note that they are presented in their original form, without modifications. Therefore, the concepts and coding style reflect my skills and knowledge as of 2017-18, rather than my current capabilities. Please overlook any technical or logical errors in the projects.

Please note that the Sudoku Solver and Tower of Hanoi projects were developed in the BlueJ editor at that time and may encounter display issues in other IDEs.

## Projects

### 1) Sudoku Solver
I got the idea for developing a Sudoku Solver when I saw my grandfather solving sudokus daily from the newspaper. Witnessing him solve Sudokus inspired me to explore if a computer could replicate the process. Excited about implementing my Java knowledge, I took up the challenge. From the outset, I was determined to develop it independently, without internet assistance and hence, this experience not only honed my programming skills but also strengthened my logical thinking and mathematical abilities. As the project progressed, I delved into possibility-based solving methods, some of which my grandfather taught me. Additionally, I developed an interface for easy number entry using Java AWT and graphics, which led me to learn about event handling, graphics, and other essential programming concepts.

### 2) Tower of Hanoi
I developed the Tower of Hanoi game during my holiday after completing Grade 9. Seeking an exciting project to occupy my time, I decided to create my version of the famous game Tower of Hanoi. Initially, the game was text-based and lacked visual appeal. To enhance user experience, I embarked on developing visuals through text manipulation and animated symbol display. This endeavor required substantial critical thinking and coding efforts. Developed in the BlueJ editor, the animation functions seamlessly within that environment. However, it may encounter display issues in other IDEs due to differences in terminal clearing commands.

### 3) 4 Colour Code Guess
This was my first Java project, developed during the 9th grade. Serving as my introduction to programming, it laid the foundation for my subsequent projects and fostered my passion for coding.
